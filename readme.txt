Allows you to create and display banners in WordPress.

== Description ==

Basic Banner is a plugin that allows you to create and display banners in WordPress. This plugin creates custom post type called banner to store all the banners.

= Displaying the Banner =

You can display the banners by using basic banner widget. There is also a shortcode :

`[basicbanner name="" class=""]`

And a function for displaying banners anywhere in your theme :

`<?php basic_banner_show( $name, $class = ''); ?>`

Parameter `$name` is the banner slug and `$class` is the additional HTML classes for banner container.  To get the banner object, you can use this function :

`<?php $banner = basic_banner_get( $name ); ?>`

= Override Banner Template =

1. Locate folder **template** in Basic Banner plugin folder (wp-content/plugins/basic-banner/template).
2. Copy **banner.php** file to your theme folder under the folder called **basic-banner** (wp-content/themes/your-theme/basic-banner/banner.php).
3. Modify **banner.php** file as you like.

= Contribute on GitHub =
