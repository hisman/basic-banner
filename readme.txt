== Description ==

Basic Banner is a plugin that allows you to create and display banners in WordPress. This plugin creates custom post type called banner to store all the banners.

= Displaying the Banner =

You can display the banner anywhere in your theme by calling this function :

`<?php basic_banner_show( $name ); ?>`

Please note that `$name` is the banner slug. To get the banner object, you can use this function :
